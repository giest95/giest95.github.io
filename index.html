<h1>
  Alec Hooyman
</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm a WordPress and WooCommerce developer. I specialize in building custom themes, creating Wordpress based software, and solving tricky site issues. 
  I'd like to think of myself as a digital craftsman. I like to build websites, tweak code, and ensure even the tiniest pixel lands where it should. 
  Whether it’s a wedding site in Divi, an invoice portal, or syncing products in WooCommerce, you can usually find me diving in and debuging with precision.
</p>
<p>
  I like to dig into problems and get my hands dirty. If something’s broken, I'll wrestle with it until it’s fixed. 
  If I don’t know the answer, I'm quick to ask, because what matters most is getting it right.
  My questions cut straight to the core, and I prefer solutions that work — no fluff. From aligning images to handling cron jobs, I'm methodical and deliberate.
